# ubihack
Java raspberry pi application for the Newcastle University ubicomp hackathon (2015).

This application utilises the Raspberry Pi and GrovePi kit, specifically using the LED display and a variety of switches and sensors to create an ambient assistant for the elderly.

The basic idea is that the kit allows a user to join a local group of individuals and promote socialising. The kit transmits friendly messages between users when they make cups of tea and stuff :)
